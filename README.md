# Cleaning-Student-Data
This project is made in partial fulfillment of the Service Design Innovation Project for my master degree. The student data is from the University of Maastricht.

Do note that this piece of code is part one of four for the entire project. However, since the purpose of this github account is to serve as my portfolio and proof of my coding capabilities, I will only include code that I have personally written. With that being said, this piece of code is made by me and another group member, Robbert Lalisang. The whole code was written by me, except from lines 117-1148, which was Mr. Lalisang's part. 

This code exhibits my skills in data cleaning, wrangling, and feature engineering. It served as a learning experience in getting proficient with different packages, especially the dplyr. The main challenge is in finding alternatives to inefficient for loops. 

For more details about the project, one can read it in the code itself. It is heavily documented via comments.
